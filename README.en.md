## About

**Full AIGC Plugins** is the plugin marketplace for AI-generated content (AIGC), covering image generation, video creation, audio/music, 3D production, and multimodal workflows, across the Codex, ZCode, and Kimi Code host platforms.

This repository is the plugin-side counterpart of [Full AIGC Skills](https://github.com/partme-ai/full-aigc-skills): the skills side captures domain knowledge ("how to think"), while the plugin side ships executable capability ("what you can do") — MCP tools, generation pipelines, and approval/verification gates. Both follow the same domain layout within one ecosystem.

> This repository contains marketplace metadata only (catalog and per-platform manifests), not plugin runtime code. Each plugin is maintained in its own repository, aligned by `catalog.json` as the single source of truth for IDs, names, versions, categories, and repository addresses.

### Coverage

| Domain | Problem | Solution (plugins) |
|--------|---------|--------------------|
| **Image generation** | Text-to-image, batch production, quality evaluation | image-factory, dreamina-design, comfy-design |
| **Video creation** | Text/image-to-video, editing to final cut | minimax-design, video-factory, jianying-edit, volcengine-design |
| **3D production** | Scene building, previs, rendering | blender-design, maya-design |
| **Multimodal workflows** | Node canvases, structured orchestration | dreamina-canvas, comfy-design, volcengine-design |
| **Film production planning** | Story → shot list → storyboard | partme-cine-planning (planning repo, unreleased) |

> The planning repository [`cine-planning`](https://github.com/full-aigc-plugins/cine-planning) (`director` / `script` / `storyboard`, specifications only) is tracked by this marketplace under the `design_baseline_not_released` status and stays out of every installable manifest until its own release boundary is complete.

> The candidate plugin [`content-factory-plugin`](https://github.com/full-aigc-plugins/content-factory-plugin) remains independently governed in `candidatePlugins`. Version `1.0.0-rc.2` is exposed to Codex, ZCode, and Kimi as `release_candidate_installable` for controlled test installation; its production release gate remains `BLOCKED`, so it is neither production-ready nor a stable release.

## Architecture

### How the marketplace works

`catalog.json` is the single source of truth. `scripts/sync-marketplaces.mjs` generates the three platform manifests from it and validates each plugin repository's skills directories (frontmatter, naming consistency), explicit candidate state (hidden blocked or installable RC), immutable release identity, and planning-repo constraints (no published manifests):

```
full-aigc-plugins/
├── catalog.json                        # Single source of truth: IDs / names / versions / categories / repos
├── .agents/plugins/marketplace.json    # Codex manifest (generated)
├── marketplace.json                    # ZCode manifest (generated)
├── kimi-marketplace.json               # Kimi manifest (generated)
└── scripts/                            # Sync and release tooling
```

Each independent plugin repository owns its runtime adapters: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.zcode-plugin/plugin.json`, and `kimi.plugin.json`.

`scripts/sync-release-tooling.mjs` only creates a missing `AGENTS.md` by default and preserves
repository-specific instructions. Existing templates are refreshed only with the explicit
`--refresh-agents` flag; use `--dry-run` to inspect the affected files first.

### Progressive disclosure

Skills inside plugins follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io):

1. **At startup**: only skill names and descriptions are loaded (minimal context)
2. **On demand**: the full `SKILL.md` loads when the agent recognizes a relevant task
3. **In depth**: reference files are read only when explicitly needed

## Contributing

### Release discipline

Any plugin code change (no matter the size) requires a version bump and release; marketplaces detect updates by version number:

```bash
node scripts/bump-plugin.mjs <plugin-id> <major|minor|patch>
```

The command updates the catalog version, syncs the four manifests in the plugin repository, and regenerates the three platform manifests.

### Adding a plugin

1. Build the plugin in its own repository with the three-platform adapter layer (`.codex-plugin` / `.zcode-plugin` / `kimi.plugin.json`)
2. Register the entry in `catalog.json`
3. Run `node scripts/sync-marketplaces.mjs --write` to regenerate manifests, then commit
